# How to read source code

### Why itâ€™s important

1. Most of your time will be spent reading, not writing.
2. Simulates working at a company or open source project.
3. It's the fastest way to learn and improve.
5. Learn how to ignore large parts of a codebase and get a piece-by-piece understanding.

### Before you start

1. Read the docs (if they exist).
2. Run the code.
3. Play with the code to see how it behaves.
4. Think about how the code might be implemented.
5. Get the code into an editor so that you can modify it.
6. Look at the file structure.

### The process

1. Get a sense for the vocabulary.
2. Make note of any unfamiliar concepts that you might need to research later.
3. Do a quick read-through without diving into concepts from #2.
4. Test one feature with the debugger.
5. Document and add comments to confusing areas.
6. Research items in #2 only if required.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 if you want to understand more.

### Next level

1. Replicate parts of the app by hand (in the console).
2. Make small changes and see what happens.
3. Add a new feature.

# Understanding `this`

There isn't a single word that describes `this` well, so I just think of it as a special variable or more specifically javascript calls it an _"implicit parameter"_. This value changes depending on the how and where the code is being ran. Those different situations are captured below.

### Case 1: In a regular function (or if you're not in a function at all), `this` points to the `window` object when you are running your code in the browser. If you are running your code in Node `this` will point to the `global` object. This is the default case.

```javascript
function logThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

logThis(); // window || global

// In strict mode, `this` will be `undefined` instead of `window`. 
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
```

### Case 2: When a function is called as a method, `this` points to the object that's on the left side of the dot.

```javascript

/*
 * You can also think of this as the "left of the dot" rule. 
 * For example, in myObject.myMethod(), `this` will be myObject
 * because myObject is to the left of the dot.
 *
 * Of course, if you're using this syntax myObject['myMethod'](),
 * technically it would be the "left of the dot or bracket" rule,
 * but that sounds clumsy and generally terrible.
 *
 * If you have multiple dots, the relevant dot is the one closest 
 * to the method call. For example, if you have one.two.hi();
 * `this` inside of hi will be two.
 */

var myObject = {
  myMethod: function() {
    console.log(this);
  }
};

myObject.myMethod(); // myObject

```

### Case 3: In a function that's being called as a constructor (using the `new` keyword), `this` points to the object that is automatically created by the `new` keyword and subsequently returned from the constructor function.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

var gordon = new Person('gordon'); // <-- notice the use of the new keyword
console.log(gordon); // {name: 'gordon'}
```

### Case 4: When you explicitly set the value of `this` manually using `bind`, `apply`, or `call`, it's all up to you.

```javascript
function logThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

var explicitlySetLogThis = logThis.bind({name: 'Gordon'});

explicitlySetLogThis(); // {name: 'Gordon'}

// Note that a function returned from .bind (like `boundOnce` below),
// cannot be bound to a different `this` value ever again.
// In other words, functions can only be bound once.
var boundOnce = logThis.bind({name: 'The first time is forever'});

// These attempts to change `this` are futile.
boundOnce.bind({name: 'why even try?'})();
boundOnce.apply({name: 'why even try?'});
boundOnce.call({name: 'why even try?'});
```

### Case 5: In a callback function, apply the above rules methodically.

```javascript

function outerFunction(callback) {
  callback();
}

function logThis() {
  console.log(this);
}

/*
 * Case 1: The regular old default case.
 */
 
outerFunction(logThis); // window || global

/*
 * Case 2: Call the callback as a method
 * (You'll probably NEVER see this, but I guess it's possible.)
 */
 
function callAsMethod(callback) {
  var weirdObject = {
    name: "Don't do this in real life"
  };
  
  weirdObject.callback = callback;
  weirdObject.callback();
}

callAsMethod(logThis); // `weirdObject` will get logged to the console

/*
 * Case 3: Calling the callback as a constructor. 
 * (You'll also probably never see this. But in case you do...)
 */
 
function callAsConstructor(callback) {
  new callback();
}

callAsConstructor(logThis); // the new object created by logThis will be logged to the console

/*
 * Case 4: Explicitly setting `this`.
 */
 
function callAndBindToGordon(callback) {
  var boundCallback = callback.bind({name: 'Gordon'});
  boundCallback();
}

callAndBindToGordon(logThis); // {name: 'Gordon'}

// In a twist, we give `callAndBindToGordon` a function that's already been bound.
var boundOnce = logThis.bind({name: 'The first time is forever'});
callAndBindToGordon(boundOnce); // {name: 'The first time is forever'}
```

### Case 6: ES6 Arrow functions ðŸ˜²
#### Arrow functions behave a little differently than regular function declarations or functions expressions when it comes to the `this` implicit parameter. Mainly... arrow functions don't have an implicit `this` parameter ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤”. Arrow functions receive their value of `this` lexically just like any other value in Javascript. 

#### Another way to think about it is that in all the rules about `this` above, the value of `this` was defined at run time (when the function was called)

```javascript

// when we define the function the value of this is not yet defined
function foo (){
  console.log (this);
};

const myObject = {
  myMethod : foo
}

// here, when we invoke "myMethod" the "this" rules take effect and its value is defined
myObject.myMethod();

// you can almost think of it as looking like this under the hook in JS
myObject.myMethod(this = myObject);

```

#### HOWEVER, when using ES6 Arrow functions the value of `this` is determined lexically and time you define your function

```javascript
const foo = ()=>{
  console.log(this);
};

const myObject = {
  myMethod: foo
};

// since there is no implicit "this" and out function is trying to log "this" to the console, JS is going to keep looking outward and outward in scope for the first reference to "this" it can find. In the example here there is not value of "this" so javascript uses it's default value of window or global.
myObject.myMethod();


```
